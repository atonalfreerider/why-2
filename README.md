# why

A causality graph that starts at the big bang, and ends at the present moment. The graph has three sections:

- RED: All matter in the Universe
- GREEN: All life on Earth
- BLUE: All of human history

![plot](./first-three.png)

The radial scale displays two dimensions:
- Angular dimension clockwise on a logarithmic scale that places the big bang at 6, the creation of life at 10, and human history at 3
- Radial dimension is a mass/distance scale for matter, relational scale for species, and West to East location and population for human society
